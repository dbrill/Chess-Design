# Chess-Design

I started this project by forking the initial skeleton for a text based implementation....

I implemented the logic for each piece's movement, checking for check(mate), and generally valid
moves on the player's end (not moving a piece that isn't yours, not moving over your own piece, ...etc..)

I also implemented a gui that would allow you to select a move by clicking a space rather than driving
the game with text input. 

Images are to come! 



-- This project was forked from another repository and is not originally my own. The impetus for this was to practice Java, OOP, the MVC design pattern, and potentially above all to practice working within a codebase that isn't my own --
